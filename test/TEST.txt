DESCRIPTION
Test MicrobeCensus on a synthetic metagenome with a known AGS (3,530,599 bp).
If MicrobeCensus is running properly, it should produce an estimated AGS of 3,529,387 (0.3% error) when run with default parameters.

COMMAND
microbe_cenus.py sim_metagenome.fa.gz estimated_ags.txt

FILES
true_ags.txt
-True average genome size of community (3,530,599 bp)

mock_community.txt
-Relative abundance and genome sizes of 20 members in medium-complexity mock community

sim_metagenome.fa.gz
-Simulated metagenome containing 100 bp error-free reads
-Coverage of each genome in metagenome is proportional to that genome's relative abundance
-Summed coverage across all 20 genomes is 2x
